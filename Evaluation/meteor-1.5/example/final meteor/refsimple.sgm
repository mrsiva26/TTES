Raam went to the market
He bought many fruits
A monkey came when he was eating fruits
They confiscated those fruits
He was very upset and went home
She smiled
He read the book
He shouted In anger
She cried in sorrow
Her name is tamilaraci
She jumped with joy
he died in February
He read a book
He stood in the step
They go shopping
I walked from Kanyakumari to Chennai
What did  she do?
Kannagi burned madurai
Vasanhth left fast
Hanuman gave ring
Kaaveeri saw a devil
What did  she do like that ?
I will read in the morning
She is an epic
Cauvery saw  a horrible ghost
the letter came to us in the morning
worst riots broke out yesterday
While he  went in rain, tree fell
mahapararatam is an epic and codes of laws
A King lived in a town
Those boxes were painted red
He came across loss of money
The girl gave a solution
The boy said thanks to the master
He stood up
