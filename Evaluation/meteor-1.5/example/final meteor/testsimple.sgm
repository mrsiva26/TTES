Ram went to the market
He bought many berries
Monkey when he was eating berries
It stripped the berries
He was very upset and went home
She smiled
He read the books
He shouted in anger
She cried in sorrow
Her name tamilaraci
She jumped with joy
He died in February
Read the book
He stood in the
They go shopping
I walked from Kanyakumari to Chennai
What did  she do?
Kannagi burned Madurai
Vasant left the fast
Hanuman gave ring
Kaaveeri saw the devil
What did  she do?
I read in the morning
She is an epic
Cauvery saw a horrible beast
The letter came to us in the morning
The worst riots broke out yesterday
When the tree fell on him in the shower
It is an epic and a aranul mahapararatam
Lived a king of a town
The red color of the boxes pucappattiruntatu
He came across loss money
The girl gave a solution
The boy said plainly thanks to the master
He stood up
